# üß≠ TopoMT ‚Äî Feature Attributes Catalog (v1)

This document defines **purely geometric, energy-agnostic attributes** for each **feature dimensionality class (0D / 1D / 2D)** in the TopoMT topographic model.  
These attributes are intended to be the **core structural descriptors** used for indexing, ranking, graph construction, and machine learning applications.

## üîê Notes

- These attributes are **pure geometry**, with no energetic or dynamic information.  
- They are **designed for deterministic reproducibility**: same structure ‚Üí same attributes.  
- They support a **topographic graph** interpretation:
  - 0D = nodes,
  - 1D = edges,
  - 2D = faces.
- Energetic information (hotspots, binding energies, dynamics) should live in a **separate annotation layer**, not in the geometry model.

---

## üß≠ Recommended Usage

- **Pharmacophore placement** along boundaries and points using `geodesic_position` and `coordinates`.
- **Site ranking** using curvature, depth/height, openness, or connectivity indices.
- **Docking seed generation** based on 0D critical points (pit/apex) and boundary loops.
- **Geometric filtering** of molecular pathways using length/width and branching features of 1D elements.
- **Graph analysis** of molecular landscapes using connectivity between features across dimensions.
