# üß≠ TopoMT ‚Äî Feature Catalog (v5, by Dimensionality)

This catalog defines the **complete set of topographic features** used in TopoMT, structured by dimensionality:  
- **2D features**: shape patches (concavity, convexity, interface).  
- **1D features**: boundaries associated to 2D features.  
- **0D features**: points associated to 2D and/or 1D features.  

All features are **energy-agnostic** and purely geometric. Future energetic or dynamic annotations should live in separate layers.

## üîê General Notes

- These features are **purely geometric** ‚Äî no energy, force, or dynamics is encoded in this catalog.  
- **Interface** remains the canonical name for `shape_type = mixed` features.  
- Some boundaries and points may have **multiple parent 2D features** (e.g., `Seam`, `Isthmus`, `Bifurcation`).  
- Boundaries can be **open or closed** (e.g., `Mouth` vs `EdgeLoop`).  
- 0D features are critical points of the surface or boundary graph.  
- This catalog, combined with the **attributes catalog**, forms the core ontology of the TopoMT topographic model.
