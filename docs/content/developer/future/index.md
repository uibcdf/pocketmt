# Development Vision and Roadmap

The TopoMT library is designed as a foundational framework for molecular surface topography.
Its primary goal is to provide a robust, extensible,
geometric representation of molecular landscapes, enabling a wide range of
downstream applications — from drug design to structural analysis and machine
learning.

This section outlines both the conceptual vision guiding TopoMT’s evolution and
the planned technical milestones that will shape its development over time.

**Development Vision**
TopoMT aims to model molecular surfaces as structured topographic graphs,
combining 0D (points), 1D (boundaries), and 2D (shape features) in a clean and
extensible ontology.
The framework focuses on geometry first, separating topographic structure from
energetic or dynamic annotations.
This makes it suitable for systematic shape analysis, interface mapping, and
data-driven design workflows.

**Roadmap**
The roadmap defines upcoming feature classes, geometric attributes, and
topological relationships to be integrated in future versions.
It also covers planned improvements in indexing, validation rules, and
interoperability with external modeling or docking tools.
Each milestone preserves the core principles of clarity, modularity, and
scientific rigor.

This section will evolve alongside the library, serving as a living design
document that reflects both current capabilities and future directions.
